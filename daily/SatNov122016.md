made this little create-md package

makes it easy to create the file each day to start writing notes

run `node create dialy` or `npm run diary`


- creates a new `.md` file with todays date as the `filename` and `title`
- inside of `/daily/` folder

hopefully this will make me create more notes

Im enjoying node alot :feelsgood:
